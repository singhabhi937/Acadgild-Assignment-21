I decided to treat this as a classification problem by creating a new binary variable affair (did the woman have at least one affair?) and trying to predict the classification for each woman. Dataset The dataset I chose is the affairs dataset that comes with Statsmodels. It was derived from a survey of women in 1974 by Redbook magazine, in which married women were asked about their participation in extramarital affairs.
